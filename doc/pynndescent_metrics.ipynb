The cost for that is that the custom distance function you write must be a numba jitted function. This, in turn, means that you can only use Python functionality that is [supported by numba](). That is still a fairly large amount of functionality, especially when we are talking about numerical work, but it is a limit.

    "### Beware of bounded distances\n",
    "\n",
    "There is one remaining caveat on custom distance functions that is important. Many distances, such as cosine distance and jaccard distance are bounded: the values always fall in some fixed finite range (in these cases between 0 and 1). When querying new data points against an index PyNNDescent bounds the search by some multiple (1 + epsilon) of the most distant of the the top k neighbors found so far. This allows a limited amount of backtracking and avoids getting stuck in local minima. It does, however, not play well with bounded distances -- a small but non-zero epsilon can end up failing to bound the search at all (suppose epsilon is 0.2 and the most distant of the the top k neighbors has cosine distance 0.8 for example). The trick to getting around this is the same trick described above when we decided not to bother taking the square root of the euclidean distance -- we can apply transform to the distance values that preserves all ordering. This means that, for example, internally PyNNDescent uses the *negative log* of the cosine *similarity* instead of cosine distance (and converts the distance values when done). You will want to use a similar trick if your distance function has a strict finite upper bound."
